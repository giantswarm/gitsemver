# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- `gitsemver next <bump-type> [--last-tag <tag>]` subcommand that computes the next semver
  release tag from the highest-semver reachable ancestor tag (or an explicit `--last-tag` value).
  Bump types from a stable tag: `patch`, `minor`, `major`, `patch-rc`, `minor-rc`, `major-rc`.
  Bump types from an RC tag: `rc` (increment counter), `rc-release` (finalize to stable).
  `--last-tag` bypasses git entirely, making the command usable outside a repository.

### Fixed

- Multiple version tags on the same commit now produce an error instead of silently
  returning a non-deterministic result (`buildVersionMaps` guard was previously unreachable).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- calling `gitsemver` now correctly returns usage info; to get a version, the `version` subcommand must be
  used: `gitsemver version`

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- `gitsemver version` subcommand that prints the build version, git SHA, and build timestamp. Version defaults
  to `devel` between releases and is updated to the release tag in source before each release. Git SHA and
  build timestamp are injected at link time via ldflags.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- feat!: Repository and Go module renamed from `gitrepo` to `gitsemver`. CLI binary renamed from
  `gitrepo-version` to `gitsemver`. Import path changed to `github.com/giantswarm/gitsemver/pkg/gitsemver`.
- feat: implement the tagging RFC
  (https://github.com/giantswarm/rfc/tree/main/semver-based-automatic-upgrades)
- feat: add tag validation API

## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-08

### Changed

- Dependency updates

## [0.3.2] - 2025-03-13

## Changed

- Errors have been made public

## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-21

- Dependency updates

## [0.3.0] - 2024-08-01

### Added

- Add support for git tag prefixes in version calculation logics. If the `GS_GIT_TAG_PREFIX` environment
  variable is set to e.g. `mymodule-a` then tags like `mymodule-a/v1.2.3` will be looked for in the history
  instead of the normal semantic versioning tags, when the env var is not set (default). New tags will be
  generated in the same format and with the same logic tho. For the above example, a few commits ahead of that
  tag the new version in a test build would be: `1.2.3-<GIT_HASH>`. When on the tag itself, it would be:
  `1.2.3`. When no tag found with the given prefix, then it would be: `0.0.0-<GIT_HASH>`. This replicates the
  original behaviour, just the tag looked up for reference changes in the behaviour. This enables creating
  sort of mono repositories where multiple modules, libraries or smaller projects are stored in a single repo
  that needs to be versioned separately.

## [0.2.4] - 2024-06-03

### Changed

- Dependency updates

## [0.2.3] - 2023-09-29

### Changed

- Upgrade go-git and go-billy dependencies to their new location. Moving from github.com/src-d to
  github.com/go-git. v4 to v5 is a drop-in replacement, see
  https://github.com/go-git/go-git/releases/tag/v5.0.0

## [0.2.2] - 2021-04-16

### Fixed

- Clean after checkout of repo to avoid leaking of folders/files.

## [0.2.1] - 2021-01-21

### Fixed

- Reading files from default branch after calling `EnsureUpToDate` on empty repo

## [0.2.0] - 2021-01-15

### Added

- Add `GetFolderContent` which fetches the contents of a folder.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-07-24

### Added

- Introduce new `IsRepositoryNotFound` error matcher

## [0.1.1] - 2020-03-17

### Added

- Add `EnsureUpToDate`: fetches latest changes from remote.
- Add `GetFileContent`: retrieves content of file.
- Add `HeadBranch`: returns branch name for the HEAD ref.
- Add `HeadSHA`: returns sha for the HEAD ref.
- Add `HeadTag`: returns tag for the HEAD ref.
- Add `ResolveVersion`: resolves version of a reference.
- Add `TopLevel`: finds absolute path of top-level git directory.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-10-10

### Added
